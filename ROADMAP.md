# NovaCut Roadmap

> Single source of truth for all planned work. Items above the `---` are
> existing plans; items below are research conducted 2026-06-03.

Active roadmap for forward-looking work. Shipped work is summarized in
[COMPLETED.md](COMPLETED.md), research synthesis lives in
[RESEARCH_REPORT.md](RESEARCH_REPORT.md), and detailed historical plans are
archived under [docs/archive](docs/archive/).

Current version: **v3.74.19** (`versionCode` 156). Last consolidated:
2026-06-04.

## Current State

- Android video editor built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Material 3, Media3
  Transformer/ExoPlayer, Room, DataStore, Hilt, ONNX Runtime, and MediaPipe.
- Current release line already includes Media3 1.10 foundation work, HDR source
  and export confidence surfaces, multi-track export composition, Ultra HDR
  source ingest, accessibility improvements, model-management trust surfaces,
  Cut Assistant scaffolding, tracked-object scaffolding, and Android 16/tablet
  readiness work.
- The active development direction is not another broad feature list. It is
  wiring the shipped scaffolds into reliable editor flows, closing release
  readiness gaps, and keeping AI/model surfaces honest about availability.
- v3.74.11 adds the first repeatable Compose instrumentation smoke harness for
  the project gallery, blank-project editor open, media picker, export sheet,
  Settings, and privacy dashboard surfaces.
- v3.74.12 reactivates release-pipeline checks for unit tests, debug/release
  APKs, instrumentation APK packaging, release metadata, signatures, APK zip
  alignment, and 16 KB native-library compliance.
- v3.74.13 makes the schema-aware recovery outcome loader the default editor
  open path and blocks autosave overwrites when recovery data is corrupt or
  written by a newer schema.
- v3.74.14 runs `MediaRelinkProbe` after project open, opens Media Manager
  when missing or unverified sources are found, and feeds probe status into
  focused relink cards.
- v3.74.15 routes timeline long-press and compound-selected radial actions to
  `EditorViewModel.openCompoundClip`, renders the state-backed breadcrumb chip,
  and keeps predictive back active by clearing clip selection on compound entry.
- v3.74.16 hosts `CaptionTranslationPanel` inside the Captions panel, builds
  rows from selected-clip captions on target-language selection, and dispatches
  edits/regeneration through the ViewModel translation surface.
- v3.74.17 adds the mixed-render export orchestrator: eligible mixed plans now
  route pass-through runs through stream-copy, re-encode runs through Media3
  Transformer, and final stitching through FFmpeg concat with release-gated
  fallback to whole-timeline Transformer.
- v3.74.18 deletes the legacy standalone FillerRemovalPanel route after the
  `filler_removal` tool action moved to Cut Assistant Review, removing its
  panel slot, ViewModel state/methods, obsolete AiFeatures analysis path, and
  panel-only strings.
- v3.74.19 migrates strict model/dependency-gated AI tool dispatch to
  `AiModelRequirementSheet`, aligns registry IDs with live editor tool IDs,
  and keeps the legacy requirement prompt only as a fallback for non-registry
  tool IDs.

## Active Queue

| Priority | Work | Exit criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | Editor state decomposition | Split `EditorState` into domain sealed substates so caption, compound, export, AI, media, and panel state can evolve independently. |
| P1 | EditorScreen panel router decomposition | Replace the large monolithic panel routing surface with smaller host components that own only their local state and callbacks. |
| P1 | Timeline refactor | Reduce `Timeline.kt` risk by extracting gesture handling, clip layout, overlays, and accessibility actions into focused files with tests where practical. |
| P1 | Model activation gates | For every active AI/model dependency, keep source locator, SHA-256, license posture, delivery mode, F-Droid posture, and runtime checksum behavior current in `docs/models.md`. |
| P2 | Project color policy consumers | Wire `ProjectColorPolicy` into Settings/export confidence once the Room/autosave migration plan is ready. |
| P2 | Diagnostic ZIP timeline-shape toggle | Expose the privacy-preserving timeline-shape summary as an explicit Settings export option. |
| P2 | Dependabot grouping and auto-tag review | Group dependency updates by toolchain risk and evaluate auto-tagging from `CHANGELOG.md` headings. |
| P2 | Fastlane changelog history | Populate `fastlane/metadata/.../changelogs/` from release history or document why the channel is unused. |
| P3 | Caption translation engine activation | Replace source-text echo behavior with a real local model path such as MADLAD-400 or Bergamot only after model gates are complete. |
| P3 | Advanced engine activations | Activate Oboe resampling, adjustment layers, keyframe graph UI, and remaining AI engines only when dependencies, APK size, 16 KB compliance, and device QA are clear. |

## Release Readiness Gates

- `targetSdk = 36` and Android 16 behavior must remain verified.
- Native dependencies must pass 16 KB page-size alignment checks before release.
- Release artifacts must have matching version names, version codes, changelog
  entries, and signed/verified build outputs.
- Any AI model or cloud-capable path must expose local-vs-cloud behavior,
  license posture, opt-in requirements, model size, and removal controls.
- F-Droid/Play channel differences must be explicit when dependencies impose
  GPL, model-download, or cloud-service constraints.

## Deferred Until Runtime Or Dependency Proof Exists

- Full real-time collaboration.
- Cloud backup beyond local project archive/import trust flows.
- Heavy generative-video or cloud inpainting paths without explicit user opt-in.
- New native libraries that have not passed 16 KB, license, and device smoke
  checks.
- Another broad roadmap research pass before the P0/P1 adoption items above are
  closed.

## Research-Backed Engine Candidates

Specific open-source implementation candidates folded from the local NovaCut OSS
research guide (`RESEARCH.md`, kept local-only and gitignored). Each is gated by
the same dependency, APK-size, 16 KB-alignment, license, and device-QA checks as
the existing "Advanced engine activations" line above. They are enumerated here so
the concrete candidate detail is not stranded in a local-only file.

- [ ] P2 — Timeline magnetic snapping and command-pattern undo
  - Why: `slipClip()`/`slideClip()` exist but are not wired to drag gestures; no
    magnetic snapping or clip grouping on the timeline.
  - Touches: timeline gesture handling, edit-command model, undo/redo.
  - Acceptance: sorted-edge 8dp proximity snap, grouped moves, and slip/slide
    wired to gestures with command-based undo, behind existing accessibility gates.
  - Source: RESEARCH.md (Kdenlive, Olive, OpenTimelineIO).
- [ ] P2 — Captions engine upgrade to Sherpa-ONNX
  - Why: current Whisper-via-ONNX path has no KV cache (O(n^2) per chunk);
    Sherpa-ONNX is ~51x faster on the same model with word-level timestamps.
  - Touches: caption transcription engine, model registry, model gates.
  - Acceptance: Sherpa-ONNX (Whisper Tiny multilingual / Moonshine English) wired
    behind model-requirement sheets with source/checksum/license/size recorded.
  - Source: RESEARCH.md (sherpa-onnx, Moonshine, Vosk).
- [ ] P2 — Video stabilization upgrade
  - Why: current stabilization is basic frame differencing; OpenCV optical flow +
    Kalman or vid.stab trajectory smoothing is substantially more robust.
  - Touches: import-time analysis, GPU affine transform apply path.
  - Acceptance: offline analysis during import, real-time GPU apply, 10-15% crop,
    gated on NDK/dependency and device QA.
  - Source: RESEARCH.md (OpenCV Android, vid.stab).
- [ ] P3 — Segmentation quality and tap-to-select
  - Why: MediaPipe selfie segmentation does a full-res GPU readback (perf issue);
    RVM adds true alpha/hair detail and MobileSAM adds tap-to-segment.
  - Touches: segmentation engine, mask compositing, selection UI.
  - Acceptance: downsampled MediaPipe readback retained for real-time, RVM as an
    AI-quality path, MobileSAM tap-select, all behind model gates.
  - Source: RESEARCH.md (MediaPipe, RobustVideoMatting, MobileSAM).
- [ ] P3 — Frame interpolation and AI upscaling activation
  - Why: frame interpolation and upscaling are stubs/unimplemented; RIFE v4.6
    (NCNN+Vulkan) and Real-ESRGAN x4plus have proven Android paths.
  - Touches: export-time engine activation, model delivery.
  - Acceptance: export-time slow-motion (24->60/120fps) and optional upscale,
    gated on Vulkan availability, model size, and 16 KB compliance.
  - Source: RESEARCH.md (RIFE, IFRNet, Real-ESRGAN).
- [ ] P3 — Neural text-to-speech and style filters
  - Why: TTS uses Android system voices; Piper-via-Sherpa-ONNX is offline and
    near-human; AnimeGANv2/fast-neural-style add creative filters.
  - Touches: TTS engine, AI filter pipeline, model registry.
  - Acceptance: Piper voices and style-transfer filters wired behind opt-in model
    download and license disclosure.
  - Source: RESEARCH.md (Piper, eSpeak NG, AnimeGANv2).
- [ ] P3 — Export codec and subtitle-burn extensions
  - Why: export is Media3 H.264/MP4; AV1 (SVT-AV1) saves 30-50% bandwidth, libass
    enables styled burned-in subtitles, FFmpegX provides a fallback encoder.
  - Touches: export orchestrator, encoder selection, subtitle render.
  - Acceptance: optional AV1 export, libass-styled subtitle burn-in, and an
    FFmpeg fallback path, each gated on device support and APK-size budget.
  - Source: RESEARCH.md (SVT-AV1, libass, FFmpegX-Android).
- [ ] P3 — Proxy media workflow
  - Why: no proxy workflow today; a 3-tier thumbnail/proxy/original pipeline keeps
    large-source editing responsive.
  - Touches: media import, background generation, preview-vs-export source switch.
  - Acceptance: WorkManager+ForegroundService proxy generation (540p H.264) with
    automatic proxy-for-preview / original-for-export switching.
  - Source: RESEARCH.md (DaVinci/Premiere proxy patterns).

## Research-Driven Additions

*Research conducted 2026-06-03. Items below are new — not duplicates of Existing Planned Work.*

These items came from a source-grounded audit (not a feature-discovery pass). The
remaining high-value gaps are in release verification depth, network/crash
hardening, localization delivery, and doc accuracy — none of which the Active
Queue (scaffold adoption/decomposition), the Research-Backed Engine Candidates
(engine activations), or the Deferred list already cover. Every claim below was
checked against `app/src/main`, `.github/workflows/build.yml`, and the manifest.

### Reliability & Security

- [ ] P0 — Install a global uncaught-exception handler
  - Why: The app ships a diagnostic-ZIP feature but has no crash capture, so a
    fatal exception is lost — nothing to attach to the diagnostic bundle and no
    recovery breadcrumb.
  - Evidence: `grep` for `setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler` /
    `UncaughtExceptionHandler` across `app/src/main/java/` returns zero hits;
    `DiagnosticExportEngine.kt` exists and is wired to Settings; `NovaCutApp.kt`
    is the `Application` with an empty-tail `onCreate()` (the natural install
    point).
  - Touches: `NovaCutApp.onCreate`, a crash-record writer feeding the existing
    diagnostic-ZIP path, autosave/recovery handoff.
  - Acceptance: an uncaught exception writes a redacted crash record into the
    diagnostic store, chains to any previous default handler, and the next
    launch surfaces it for export — no PII in the record.
  - Verify: throw in a debug build, confirm the record is written and exportable;
    confirm normal crashes still propagate to the platform after capture.
  - Complexity: M

- [ ] P2 — Add a `networkSecurityConfig` that blocks cleartext app-wide
  - Why: With the `INTERNET` permission and an OkHttp cloud path, cleartext
    HTTP is permitted by the platform default on API 26-27; an explicit config
    closes the downgrade surface and documents the cloud posture.
  - Evidence: `AndroidManifest.xml` declares `android.permission.INTERNET` with
    no `usesCleartextTraffic` attribute and no `networkSecurityConfig`; OkHttp
    5.3.2 is a declared dependency (`libs.versions.toml`).
  - Touches: `res/xml/network_security_config.xml` (new resource),
    `AndroidManifest.xml` `application` element.
  - Acceptance: `cleartextTrafficPermitted="false"` enforced app-wide (with an
    explicit allowlist only if a cleartext host is genuinely required); cloud
    calls still succeed over TLS.
  - Verify: confirm an `http://` request fails fast in a debug build; confirm
    the existing HTTPS model/cloud paths are unaffected.
  - Complexity: S

- [ ] P2 — Attach checksums and build provenance to release artifacts
  - Why: Tagged-release CI uploads APKs with no integrity proof, so a
    self-host/F-Droid consumer cannot verify a download independently.
  - Evidence: `.github/workflows/build.yml` builds/verifies/zipaligns/16 KB-checks
    APKs and uploads them, but contains no `sha256`/`checksum`/`cosign`/
    `provenance` step; `dependabot.yml` flags cosign as future work.
  - Touches: release job in `build.yml` (emit `*.sha256` next to each APK; optional
    SLSA/cosign attestation), release notes/README verification snippet.
  - Acceptance: every release asset has a published SHA-256 sum; a documented
    one-line command reproduces and matches it.
  - Verify: download a release asset and confirm the published sum matches
    locally computed `sha256sum`.
  - Complexity: S

### Quality & Friction

- [ ] P1 — Execute the instrumentation smoke suite on an emulator in CI
  - Why: The v3.74.11 Compose smoke harness is compiled and packaged but never
    run, so a green pipeline does not prove the app even launches — launch/a11y
    regressions pass CI silently.
  - Evidence: `build.yml` builds and packages the `androidTest` APK
    (`apk/androidTest/debug/*.apk` appears only in alignment/verify loops) but has
    no `connectedAndroidTest` / `connectedCheck` / emulator / Gradle Managed
    Device step.
  - Touches: `.github/workflows/build.yml` (add a Gradle Managed Device or hosted
    emulator job), test-runner config.
  - Acceptance: the gallery/blank-editor/picker/export/Settings/privacy smoke
    tests run on a device image in CI and gate the build.
  - Verify: confirm the new CI job runs the instrumentation tests green and fails
    when a smoke test is deliberately broken.
  - Complexity: M

- [ ] P1 — Ship at least one fully translated locale
  - Why: The localization scaffold is complete (~1900 externalized strings, RTL
    `BidiFormatter`, `localeConfig`) but ships zero translated locales — large
    infra investment with no end-user benefit and no real-build exercise of the
    RTL path.
  - Evidence: `res/` contains only `values/` (no `values-*` locale dirs);
    `strings.xml` is ~1937 lines; `BidiTextPolicyTest` and `locales_config.xml`
    exist.
  - Touches: new `res/values-<locale>/strings.xml`, per-app-language QA, README
    locale list.
  - Acceptance: one locale fully translated and selectable via per-app language;
    no missing-string fallbacks in that locale; if RTL is chosen, BidiFormatter
    is exercised on a real layout.
  - Verify: switch app language on a build and confirm full coverage and correct
    bidi rendering.
  - Complexity: M

- [ ] P1 — Wire slip/slide editing to timeline gestures (or scope it down)
  - Why: `slipClip()`/`slideClip()` exist in the engine but have no gesture call
    sites, so the "pro" slip/slide edit is unreachable — a core mobile-NLE
    table-stakes gap versus KineMaster/PowerDirector.
  - Evidence: `grep slipClip|slideClip Timeline.kt` returns zero matches; the
    functions are defined on the edit/engine side; README advertises the feature.
  - Touches: `Timeline.kt` gesture handling, edit-command dispatch, existing
    accessibility-action gates.
  - Acceptance: slip and slide are reachable from timeline drag (and from
    accessibility actions), routed through the edit-command/undo path.
  - Verify: perform a slip and a slide on a built editor and confirm correct
    in/out behavior plus undo.
  - Complexity: M
  - Note: overlaps the "Timeline magnetic snapping and command-pattern undo"
    Engine Candidate's gesture work; sequence after that lands to avoid churn.

### Documentation & Polish

- [ ] P2 — Correct overstated feature claims in README
  - Why: README lists slip/slide editing as shipped while it is not gesture-wired,
    which misleads users and inflates the "pro" claim.
  - Evidence: README slip/slide claim vs. zero `slipClip`/`slideClip` gesture
    sites in `Timeline.kt` (same evidence as the wiring item above).
  - Touches: `README.md` feature list.
  - Acceptance: README marks slip/slide as planned/in-progress (or the wiring
    item lands first and the claim becomes accurate); no other shipped/unshipped
    mismatches remain in the feature list.
  - Verify: cross-check each README "shipped" claim against a call site or test.
  - Complexity: S

- [ ] P3 — Realign the future-dated consolidation stamps
  - Why: `ROADMAP.md`, `COMPLETED.md`, and `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` carry a
    future-dated "Last consolidated: 2026-06-04" stamp, which undermines doc
    trust and audit trails.
  - Evidence: all three files contain `Last consolidated: 2026-06-04` (and
    `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` also `Last implementation update: 2026-06-04`), dates
    ahead of the actual edit history.
  - Touches: the date-stamp lines in those three docs.
  - Acceptance: stamps reflect the actual last-consolidation date and are kept in
    sync on future consolidations.
  - Verify: confirm each stamp matches the commit that last touched it.
  - Complexity: S

### Accessibility (audit)

- [ ] P2 — Run a WCAG 2.2 AA audit of the editor surfaces
  - Why: Edge-to-edge, predictive back, and accessibility actions are shipped,
    but contrast, 48dp touch targets, and content labels across the dense editor
    panels are unverified — and the unrun smoke suite means a11y regressions are
    not caught.
  - Evidence: COMPLETED.md lists a11y actions as shipped; no device/contrast
    audit was possible this pass (no emulator run); the CI smoke suite is built
    but not executed.
  - Touches: editor/timeline/export/Settings composables (labels, target sizes,
    color tokens), TalkBack pass.
  - Acceptance: a documented WCAG 2.2 AA checklist pass for the primary editor
    flows (contrast ratios, 48dp targets, semantic labels, TalkBack traversal).
  - Verify: TalkBack walkthrough plus an automated accessibility scanner on the
    smoke flows, both clean.
  - Complexity: M

### Quick Wins (P2/P3, < 1hr)

- P2 — Add a `networkSecurityConfig` that blocks cleartext app-wide (small XML
  resource + one manifest attribute).
- P2 — Attach SHA-256 sums to release artifacts (one CI step).
- P2 — Correct overstated slip/slide claim in README.
- P3 — Realign the future-dated "Last consolidated: 2026-06-04" stamps.

### Larger Bets (P0/P1, staged)

- P0 — Global uncaught-exception handler feeding the diagnostic-ZIP path (crash
  capture + recovery surfacing).
- P1 — Execute the instrumentation smoke suite on an emulator/Managed Device in
  CI (close the "green-but-unverified" gap).
- P1 — Ship at least one fully translated locale (activate the dormant i18n
  scaffold; exercise the RTL path on a real build).
- P1 — Wire slip/slide to timeline gestures (sequenced after the command-pattern
  undo Engine Candidate).
