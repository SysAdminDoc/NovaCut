/**
 * Serializable edit commands for reliable undo/redo.
 * Each timeline operation is encapsulated as a command that can be
 * executed, undone, and serialized for crash recovery.
 *
 * Benefits over current snapshot-based undo:
 * - O(1) memory per operation (vs O(n) for full state snapshots)
 * - Serializable for crash recovery (replay commands from last checkpoint)
 * - Composable (group multiple commands into a compound command)
 *
 * Note: this does not replace the existing undo system — it provides the
 * foundation for a future migration. The current snapshot-based undo still works.
