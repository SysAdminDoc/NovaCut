/**
 * R5.4b — Bidirectional text policy for overlay rendering.
 *
 * ClearCut's text-overlay path (`StrokedTextBitmapOverlay`, `ExportTextOverlay`)
 * draws Canvas text directly, which gives correct glyph shaping for Arabic
 * / Hebrew / Persian / Urdu / Yiddish at the typeface level but does **not**
 * apply Unicode Bidi reordering before draw. That means a mixed-direction
 * caption like `"Hello مرحبا"` can render with the Arabic run misordered,
 * and pure-RTL overlays anchor their alignment from the wrong side of the
 * frame.
 *
 * This policy is the pure-Kotlin half of the fix:
 *  - [classify] inspects a string and returns the dominant text direction
 *    (`LTR`, `RTL`, or `MIXED`). The classifier uses the same Unicode
 *    bidi-class buckets `android.text.BidiFormatter` uses internally, but
 *    without an Android runtime so the engine layer can use it.
 *  - [recommendAlignment] maps a direction onto a default
 *    [PreferredAlignment]. The overlay renderer applies this when the
 *    user hasn't pinned a specific alignment.
 *
 * The actual `BidiFormatter.unicodeWrap(...)` call still has to happen on
 * the Android side (it injects U+200E / U+200F marks). This file lets the
 * engine layer decide *whether* to wrap; the Android side does the wrap.
